PROJECT NOTE
i'm using VIPER design architecture for this project with monolitich aproach, for the presentation layer i'm using MVVM with RxSwift for reactive programming
this project is also using Swinject for Dependency injection to make it easier when the project become modular

i'm built it in such a way because this is what i've learn when you want to build a modular project, with VIPER so the module won't be tight coupling
